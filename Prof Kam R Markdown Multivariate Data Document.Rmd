## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#2.0 Data Preparation

##2.1 Installing and Launching R Packages
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
packages = c('ggtern', 'plotly', 'tidyverse')
for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```
##2.2 Importing the Data

```{r}
agegroup = read_csv("data/AgeGroup2015.csv")
```

##2.3 Preparing the Data

```{r}
#Deriving the young, economic active and old measures. with replacing of NA with 0 to avoid premature termination of summing.

agpop_mutated <- agegroup %>%
  replace(is.na(.), 0) %>%
  mutate(YOUNG = rowSums(.[5:9])) %>%
  mutate(ACTIVE = rowSums(.[10:17])) %>%
  mutate(OLD = rowSums(.[18:22]))
```

#3.0 Visualising and Analysing Three Continuous Variables

##3.1 Creating a Ternary Plot
```{r}
#Building the static ternary plot
ggtern(data = agpop_mutated, aes(x=YOUNG, y=ACTIVE, z=OLD)) + geom_point()
```

##3.1.1 Customising the Ternary Plot
```{r}
#Building the static ternary plot
ggtern(data = agpop_mutated, aes(x=YOUNG, y=ACTIVE, z=OLD)) + geom_point() + labs(title = "Population Structure, 2015") + theme_rgbw()
```

##3.2 Creating an Interactive Ternary Plot
```{r}
#Reusable function for creating annotation objects
label = function(txt){
  list(
    text = txt,
    x = 0.1, y =1,
    ax = 0, ay = 0,
    xref = "paper", yref = "paper",
    align = "center",
    font = list(family = "serif", size = 15, color = "white"),
    bgcolor = "#b3b3b3", bordercolor = "black", borderwidth = 2
  )
}

#Reusable function for axis formatting
axis = function(txt){
  list(
    title = txt,
    tickformat = ".0%",
    tickfont = list(size = 10)
  )
}

ternaryAxes = list(
  aaxis = axis("Young"),
  baxis = axis("Active"),
  caxis = axis("Old")
)

#Initiating a plotly visualisation
plot_ly(
  agpop_mutated,
  a = ~YOUNG,
  b = ~ACTIVE,
  c = ~OLD,
  color = I("black"),
  type = "scatterternary"
) %>%
  layout(
    annotations = label("Ternary Markers"),
    ternary = ternaryAxes
  )

```
